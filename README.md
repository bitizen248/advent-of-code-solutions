# Advent of Code 2023 - bitizen's solutions

## What is this?

This is my repository for [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) solutions.
All solutions are in Python 3.12 and have tests. Each day in a separate directory. All inputs are in `input` directory.

You can run each script separatly. Example:

```bash
python day_1/part_1.py
```

### Running tests

To run tests you need to install `pytest`:

```bash
pip install pytest
```

Then you can run tests:

```bash
pytest
```
